          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
          staff and patient themselves &mdash; making you more productive, less
          stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

        You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or

        Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your
        notes, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas
        learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every
        patient you see.

        on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. The right information
        is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages
         technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide."

          <p class="third-paragraphs">
            Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you
            understand performance, but they aren't enough to
            improve quality and increase revenue day after day.
            Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so
            clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can
            do.
